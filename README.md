## Project Overview

The task manager contains four sections:

1).Create task : You can jot down your tasks quickly using this form, only task description is mandatory, rest of the fields can be filled later on.

2).Update task (modify, assign, reshuffle) : Update your tasks by putting due date, and assigning to to one of the team members. You can also drag and drop your tasks using **reshuffle**  button on top.

3).Task report : Search tasks using filters using this section.

4).Team status: This section is like watsapp status where team members will mandatorily update their status. Also team can raise flags if any one is stucked at some place while development, his/her profile will be marked with red indicator, anyone who notices it extend help and get the task resolved quickly. There is chat section where team members will chat rather than using any other chat platform.

## Other Features

1. This mini task manager is fully responsive and works on all device sizes.
2. It gives proper messages on data save,update and error.
3. If token is removed from local storage, user will be logged out and asked to login.
4. It uses a very highly scalable architecture and this mini task manager can even be scaled up to 200 or more components without at all slowing down the application.
5. There are some specific client side design patterns have been used which makes the entire development relatively fast. That design patter I have innovated after R & D.
